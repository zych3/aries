# Project: ARIES

This is a simple game scratch I'm currently working on. It's made in SFML.

## PREMISE

Aries (codename as of now) will be a dark, castlevania-esque platformer/metroidvania. My main goal for the scratch (call it a tech-demo, if you wish) is implementing a fluent movement, 3 different weapons, one playable level, a few kinds of enemies, a boss fight and debug tools. 

## GAMEPLAY

Gameplay will be most likely inspired by blasphemous, with a bit of DMC and other japanese slasher games influences.
